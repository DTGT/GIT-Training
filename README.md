# GIT-Training
This will serve as a repository to practice git commands

📘 GIT Training
This repository is my personal training ground for learning and practicing Git and GitHub.
It contains exercises, notes, and example projects to help me build confidence with version control.

🚀 Goals
Practice Git basics (init, add, commit, status, log).
Learn branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.
Explore working with remotes (push, pull, clone).
Experiment with .gitignore, tags, and stashing.
Simulate collaboration using pull requests and forks.

📂 Contents
notes.md → quick references and commands.
exercises/ → small projects and practice files.
.gitignore → ignored files for clean commits.

🛠️ Tech Used
